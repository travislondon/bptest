     *   thread. By contrast, an asynchronous listener invocation always occurs
     *   on the UI thread.
     * - In the case of a listener synchronously invoked from Verifier,
     *   execution completes entirely in the Verifier execution thread. This
     *   will therefore directly degrade Verifier performance.
     *   
     *   All uses of a synchronous listener must consider these consequences
     *   a) return control as quickly as possible, b) do not attempt any UI
     *   updates without using a Display.*exec() call (and preferably use the
     *   asyncExec variant).
