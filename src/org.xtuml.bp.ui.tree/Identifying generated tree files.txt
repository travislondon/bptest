Identifying generated tree files
----------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
The tree generation infrastructure is quite flexible.  When reading this
document, whenever you see a word enclosed in <> symbols, that is an argument
name that can be passed to the generate_skeleton_files.xml builder for your
project.  For example, assume that you have passed the following arguments to
the builder:
-Dproject=org.xtuml.bp.ui.explorer
-Dproject_with_slash=org/xtuml/bp/ui/explorer
-Dprefix=InstanceExplorer

whenever you see the word <project> in this document, it would be replaced by
org.xtuml.bp.ui.explorer.  So the following path:
   <project>/src/<project_with_slash>
translates into 
   org.xtuml.bp.ui.explorer/src/org/xtuml/bp/ui/explorer

Please look at the top section of ....bp.ui.tree/generate_skeleton_files.xml
in order to find a complete set of properties that can be passed as argumenrts.


Assumed Existing Files
----------------------------------
	<project>/.project
	  This file among other things defines the builders that will be launched
	  when a user attempts to build or clean this project.  In addition to
	  generating skeleton java files, the generate_skeleton_file.xml script
	  also creates a new builder launch file and adds a reference to it in
	  the .project file.

	<project>/plugin.xml
	<project>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF (optional)
	  The script assumes that a plug-in project already exists, but does not
	  assume that the project uses an OSGI Manifest.  If the manifest file
	  exists, then plug-in dependencies may be added to it.  If the manifest
	  does not exist, then the plug-in dependencies will be added to the
	  plugin.xml file.
	
	<project>/src/<project_with_slash>/<plugin_name>Plugin.java
	  Since the script assumes that a plugin project already exists, a plugin
	  file is neither generated nor modified.  Instead of modifying the plugin
	  to match the generated files, the arguments used to generate the files
	  should be changed to match the values for the plug-in.

Generated Skeleton Files
----------------------------------
The following files should be checked into version control after being
generated.  These are the files that you should modify to tweak your new
view to do whatever you require.

	<project>/.externalToolBuilders
	----------------------------------
	<builder_name>.launch         - Referred to in the .project file, this
	                                custom launch file will automatically be
	                                added to your project in order to execute
	                                the new generate.xml script whenever this
	                                project is built or cleaned.

	<project>/src/<project_with_slash>
	----------------------------------
	I<helpcontextids_prefix>HelpContextIds.java
	                              - Project specific constants
	<treeviewer_prefix>TreeViewer.java
	                              - Constitutes most of the view's screen
	                                real estate
	
	<project>/src/<project_with_slash><slash_actions>
	----------------------------------
	FilterSelectionAction.java    - Opens the filters dialog
	
	<project>/src/<project_with_slash><slash_adapters>
	----------------------------------
	DomainProxyAdapter.java
	RootAdapter.java
	
	<project>/arc
	----------------------------------
	BuildTree.arc                 - Called by generate.xml, this archetype is
	                                responsible for generating the following:
	                                  - The view file
	                                  - The remaining adapters
	                                  - The label provider
	                                  - The content provider
	                                  - The filters content provider
	                                If you do not want to generate one of these
	                                files, then comment out the section of code
	                                that invokes the function and emits the
	                                results to the file.
	create_<view_name>.inc        - Called by BuildTree.arc, this template is
	                                used to create a custom view java file for
	                                your project.  If you want to change view
	                                functionality, this is the place.
	
	<project>/sql
	----------------------------------
	UITree.pei.sql                - Determines the content of your tree
	                                Each class and parameter in this file
	                                maps directly to a class and attribute in
	                                the UITree.xtuml model stored in the
	                                bp.ui.tree/models folder.  By modifying this
	                                file, you can change just about everything
	                                regarding the content of your tree.  For
	                                more information, read the Adding a new node
	                                to a generated tree.txt file in the same
	                                directory as this document.
	
	<project>
	----------------------------------
	generate.xml                  - The .project file includes a builder that
	                                will launch this new script.  This script
	                                is responsible for cleaning and building
	                                the remaining generated files that should
	                                not be kept in version control.  It will
	                                also ensure that the schema for the tree
	                                (stored in ....bp.ui.tree/sql) has been
	                                generated.  The generated java files will
	                                also be run through a format utility to
	                                make the code comply with coding standards.
	                                Then the generated code will be compiled.
