<h1 id="package-references">Package References</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To formalize the use of shared class models, support for package references is<br />
being added to BridgePoint.</p>
<p>Prior to BridgePoint 5.8 classes must be defined within a component to be useful<br />
throughout the entire tool chain. However, it is possible to define classes<br />
(and functions) outside a component, and elements defined within a component<br />
will have visibility to these externally defined elements so long as they<br />
reside within the same project.</p>
<p>While the parser recognizes this visibility and parses actions referring to<br />
externally defined elements, the remainder of the tool chain does not fully<br />
support such elements. Even though these capabilities have been in place for<br />
several years (as a step toward shared classes), without the ability to execute<br />
and compile models, they have not been widely used.</p>
<p>Package References allow the modeler to explicitly give local visibility to<br />
elements that exist inside another package.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<h3 id="creating-package-references">Creating Package References</h3>
<p>Unlike Component References, Package References do not have their own graphical<br />
tool in the Palette.</p>
<p>To create a Package Reference:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select the Package tool in the Palette and add a package inside a Component</p></li>
<li><p>Right-click on the package to open the context-menu and select <code>Assign As Package Reference...</code><br />
<img src="assign_pkgref.png" alt="Assign Package Reference Menu" /></p></li>
<li><p>Choose the target package to refer to<br />
<img src="assign_pkgref_dlg.png" alt="Assign Package Reference Dialog" /></p></li>
<li><p>The displayed name of the package will change to show the path to the referred-to package<br />
<img src="assigned_pkgref_path.png" alt="Assigned Package Reference" /></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packages must be empty in order to make them a Package Reference</li>
<li>Only Packages directly under a Component may be Package References</li>
<li>Once a Package is assigned as a Package Reference, elements may not be added to it</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="component-opacity">Component Opacity</h3>
<p>Closely associated with Package References is the concept of &quot;component<br />
opacity&quot;. By this we mean: does the boundary of a component create a wall that<br />
keeps elements inside the component from seeing elements outside the component?<br />
When components are opaque, the modelers must use package references to import<br />
elements and functionality from other packages into the component. BridgePoint<br />
has a preference that determines whether components are considered to be opaque<br />
or not. The default for this preference (opaque components = false) allows for<br />
backwards compatibility with existing models. It is likely this setting will<br />
change in the future as stricter use of Package References becomes more common.<br />
The setting is found in the file <code>&lt;install dir&gt;/BridgePoint/eclipse/plugins/org.xtuml.bp.pkg_&lt;version&gt;/plugin_customization.ini</code>:</p>
<pre><code>org.xtuml.bp.core/bridgepoint_prefs_opaque_components=false</code></pre>
<h2 id="model-compilers">Model Compilers</h2>
<p>Package References are implemented in the xtUML metamodel with a new<br />
reflexive-associative relationship <code>R1402</code> and class <code>Package Reference [EP_PKGREF]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="pkgref.png" alt="Package Reference" /></p>
<p>BridgePoint model compilers are updated to handle this relationship and traverse<br />
to the referred-to package if a package is found that has an associated Package<br />
Reference across <code>R1402</code>.</p>
<p>Custom-developed model compilers must be updated to handle this relationship<br />
as well.</p>
