<h1 id="downgrade-dialog">Downgrade Dialog</h1>
<p>Several actions, including delete, rename, move, and visibility change, cause<br />
the appearance of this dialog:</p>
<p><img src="dialog.png" alt="Image of Downgrade Dialog" /></p>
<p>It indicates that the action in question, if completed, will cause the (likely<br />
undesirable) disassociation of model elements. The following model element<br />
types may be involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribute, referring to a data type</li>
<li>Parameter, referring to a data type</li>
<li>Data type, referring to a data type</li>
<li>Constant specification, referring to a data type</li>
<li>Imported class, referring to a class</li>
<li>Component reference, referring to a component definition</li>
<li>Component definition, referring to an interface definition (through formalization of a port)</li>
<li>Package reference, referring to a package</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deletion of a data type causing all parameters and attributes typed by the<br />
deleted data type to be reverted to the corresponding core type.</li>
<li>Moving of classes such that they lose visibility to data types to which they<br />
refer for typing of attributes and parameters.</li>
<li>Changing the visibility of a package such that referring model elements no<br />
longer have visibility to some of the model elements to which they refer. For<br />
example an imported class no longer has visibility to the class to which it refers.</li>
<li>Moving a package such that a component reference has lost visibility to the<br />
associated component definition or a component definition can no longer see an<br />
interface definition used to formalize one of its ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dialog presents an opportunity to copy or print the list of affected model<br />
elements before either continuing or canceling the operation. Typically it is<br />
best to prevent the dissociation of the affected model elements before<br />
continuing with the operation in question, so it is recommended that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy or print the list of affected elements.</li>
<li>Cancel the operation.</li>
<li>Adjust the model to ensure visibility between the affected elements will be<br />
maintained after the contemplated operation is completed.</li>
<li>Perform the operation in question.</li>
</ol>
