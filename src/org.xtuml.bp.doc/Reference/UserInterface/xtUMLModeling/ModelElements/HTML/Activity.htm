<h2>Activity Diagram</h2>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Many
of the following definitions of were derived in part from descriptions and
definitions in <i>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual,</i> Second
Edition; and <i>UML Distilled</i>, Third Edition.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Activity
diagrams describe procedural logic flow between activities; where an activity
is defined as a specification of executable behavior.  Activity diagrams are
informal in the sense that they do not impose behavior on formal diagrams, such
as the instance or class state machine diagrams.  Activity diagrams may be
placed in domain and subsystem packages or nested inside other activity
diagrams.</span></p>

<h3>Partition</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Activity
partitions may be used to specify which actions a class instance or
organization unit carries out.  Historically only vertical partitions were used
on activity diagrams.  The BridgePoint activity diagram editor allows
partitions to be oriented in any direction.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
activity partition is represented by a solid thin line.  If the partition is
named, a floating text box on the diagram adorns the partition.</span></p>

<h3>Edge</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
edge is an abstraction of the procedural connection between activities.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
activity edge is represented by a thin solid line.  It is terminated with an open
arrow head at the destination end of the connection. If the edge is named, a
floating text box on the diagram adorns the edge. </span></p>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
action abstracts an activity whose execution results in a change in the state
of the system or the return of a value.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
action is represented by a rectangle with rounded corners.  The name of the
action is displayed in the center of the rectangle.</span></p>

<h3>Object Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
object node abstracts the existence of an object produced by one action and
used by others.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
object node is represented by a rectangle.  The name of the node is displayed
in the center of the rectangle. </span></p>

<h3>Accept Event Action</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
accept event action abstracts an action whose execution blocks until a
specified message is recognized.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
accept event action is represented by a polygon where the left side is concave
and the other three sides are rectangular.  The name of the accept event action
is displayed in the center of the polygon.</span></p>

<h3>Send Signal Action</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
send signal action abstracts an action that sends a message.     </span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
send signal action is represented by a polygon where the right side is convex
and the other three sides are rectangular.  The name of the send signal event
is displayed in the center of the polygon.</span></p>

<h3>Accept Time Event</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
accept time event abstracts the creation of a message that occurs as a result
of the passage of time.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
accept time event is represented as two triangular shapes joined, one inverted
over the other, to resemble an hour glass.  The name of the accept time event
adorns the joined shapes as a free floating text box.</span></p>

<h3>Fork/Join Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
fork/join node, as the name implies, may be used to abstract either or both
forks and joins.  A fork is an activity that copies a single input onto
multiple concurrent outputs.  A join is an activity that synchronizes multiple
inputs.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
fork/join node is represented by a thick solid line.  A representation of a
fork node may be created by terminating an activity edge into one side of the
thick solid line and sourcing two or more activity edges from the other side. 
A representation of a join node may be created by terminating two or more
activity edges into one side of the thick solid line and sourcing one edge from
the other.  If a value is specified for the guard condition of the node, the
condition adorns the node as a free floating text box.  </span></p>

<h3>Decision/Merge Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
decision/merge node, as the name implies, may be used to abstract either or
both decisions and merges.  A decision is an activity that passes control and
data to one of several outputs.  A merge is an activity where two or more
alternate control paths come together.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
decision/merge node is represented by a diamond shape.  A representation of a
decision node may be created by terminating an activity edge into a vertex of
the diamond and sourcing two or more activity edges from sides of the diamond
opposite that vertex.  A representation of a merge node may be created by
terminating two or more activity edges into two adjacent sides of the diamond
and sourcing one edge from the vertex opposite the adjacent sides.  If a value
is specified for the name of the node, the name adorns the node as a free
floating text box</span></p>

<h3>Initial Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
initial node abstracts the place where execution begins when the activity is
invoked.  </span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
initial node is represented as a large solid black dot.  A single activity edge
may be sourced from the initial node.  No edges may be terminated on the
initial node.  </span></p>

<h3>Flow Final Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
flow final node abstracts the termination of a particular flow of execution in
the activity diagram.  It has no effect on other concurrent execution flows.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A
flow final node is represented by a thin solid line X shape contained inside
a thin solid line circle.</span></p>

<h3>Activity Final Node</h3>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
activity final node abstracts the termination of all activity on the activity
diagram.</span></p>

<h4>Graphical Notation</h4>

<p style='line-height:15.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>An
activity final node is represented as a large solid black dot contained in the
center of a slightly larger diameter thin solid line circle.</span></p>
