All document source in the org.xtuml.bp.doc/source directory is for
legacy and reference purposes only.

All production documentation is now checked into and version controlled at
the top level of bp.doc.  For example the source documents for the Getting
Started chapter are contained in org.xtuml.bp.doc/GettingStarted/HTML
directory tree.
