x- 01  min   bob  4.2.2,4.3.1      format
x- 02  min   bob  4.3.5      Associations -> Since this in in requirements, the 
fact that it just reads "Association" makes this not clear. I mean, 4.3.5 is NOT a requirement. Fix this up.

code review

x- 07  min   bob  general      It is believer that graphics reconciliation
