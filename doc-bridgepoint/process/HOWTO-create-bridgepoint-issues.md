6. Now use the tab header links "Overview", "Activity", etc... to see information about this project.

8. The "New issue" tab provides a form to submit a feature request or provide a description and reproduction steps for a bug.
<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
  - __NOTE:__ One Fact customers may choose to make their issue "Private" by checking the box on the New Issue form.  Private issues are only viewable by the reporter and One Fact employees.
  - A feature request should clearly define the desired requirement(s) for the new functionality.
  - A bug report should include as much information as possible about the failure, including steps for developers to reproduce the issue.

9. The "My page" link in the header shows you a personalized page that lists all the issues you have reported as well as any issues assigned to you as a contributor to the BridgePoint open source project.
