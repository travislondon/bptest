# xtUML Standard File Headers
### xtUML Project Technical Note

Abstract
--------
Our development process requires that each file produced during a process artifact
shall have a header/footer based on its type.  This document defines the 
header/footer for each file type.


Hand-written Java Files
-----------------------
A handwritten Java only has the header which is :
