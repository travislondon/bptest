3. Background
-------------
None

4. Requirements
---------------

4.1 #9001 requirements  
4.1.1 See [[2.4]](#2.4) section 4

4.2 #9047 requirements  
4.2.1 The Xtext editor shall open to the proper function body for the following
elements  
4.2.1.1 Function in a package  
4.2.1.2 Required operation in a port  
4.2.1.3 Operation in a class  
4.2.1.4 State in a state machine  

4.3 #8808 requirements  
4.3.1 The Xtext editor shall allow services with return types  
4.3.2 The Xtext editor shall properly link services with return types to the
`.mod` file  

5. Work Required
----------------
N/A

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 #9047 shall remain open even after promotion. BridgePoint is temporarily
going to move to a different Xtext editor, so #9047 is no longer critical. A
test case that covers the requirements should be written and run at the time
when the issue is fully resolved.

7. Unit Test
------------

7.1 #9001 test  
7.1.1 See [[2.4]](#2.4) section 7

7.2 #9047 test  
7.2.1 See comment in section 6.1

7.3 #8808 test  
7.3.1 Create a MASL domain service with a non void return type  
7.3.2 Open the MASL editor. Verify that there is no error marker on the service  
7.3.3 Right click on the service and click "Open Declaration". Verify that it
opens to the proper corresponding service in the `.mod` file  

8. User Documentation

None

9. Code Changes
